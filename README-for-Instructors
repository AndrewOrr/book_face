# README for Instructors

For our project we did the default app, but implemented it as an app geared toward book lovers. The user is intended to
sign up as a character and they would play that role on the site, posting and creating their profile as that character.
This required a ton more HTML and CSS to create a book-like theme that the user would enjoy.


Out of the basic functionality, we did not get the friend capability or the search function working.
