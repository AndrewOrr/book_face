README for Instructors

For our project we did the default app, but implemented it as an app geared toward book lovers. The user is intended to
sign up as a character and they would play that role on the site, posting and creating their profile as that character.
This required a ton more HTML and CSS to create a book-like theme that the user would enjoy.

Out of the basic functionality, we did not get the friend capability or the search function working. We attempted to use a
few different gems/plugins for the friends functionality as well as trying to implement it on our own, but didn't have 
success with either. We also had a ton of trouble with tests. We got the same errors with many of our tests: 
"Capybara:ElementNotFound," and saying that "#has_link?" returned false when we definitely had a link present on the page. 
We weren't able to figure out what was going on with this lack of recognition of elements that were obviously present. 
Also, while the site looks great on localhost, there were a few elements that wouldn't function when we pushed to Heroku,
such as the awesome font Jesse found to use for the first letters of headers, to add to the bookish feel of the site. The
font worked perfectly well on local but refused to work on Heroku, even after precomiling assets.
